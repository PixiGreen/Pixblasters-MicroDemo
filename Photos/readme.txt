Photographs show making of the Pixblasters micro demo that drives only 16 LED strips.
Yet, even such a small (micro!) demo can drive up to 8192 RGB LEDs. 
When using LED strips with 60 LEDs per meter, physical dimensions of directly
supportable video display are 8,7 meters (length) by roughly 30 centimeters.

Check out the video showing the small demo here: https://vimeo.com/279143549, or

Much larger displays are supportable by the full Pixblasters configuration that
